🛡️ Smart Tourist Safety ID
🚀 Overview

A next-gen tourist safety system powered by Blockchain, AI, and Geo-fencing.
Tourists get a Digital ID NFT (ERC-721, non-transferable) linked to KYC + trip details. This ensures tamper-proof identity, safe travel records, and instant verification.

🔑 Features

🎫 Tourist NFT ID → Time-bound, unique, non-transferable.

🔒 KYC on IPFS → Secure & private storage.

🛰️ Geo-fencing Alerts → Entering high-risk zones triggers warnings.

🚨 Panic Button → Shares live location with police & family.

🤖 AI Detection → Flags anomalies (deviation, inactivity, distress).

📊 Authority Dashboard → Heatmaps, alerts, tourist clustering.

🌍 Multilingual App → 10+ Indian languages + English.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Blockchain → Solidity (Foundry), ERC-721, IPFS, Oracles.

AI/ML → GRU, anomaly detection, federated learning.

Frontend → React / Flutter.

Backend → Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

Auth → Web3Auth (social login → non-custodial wallet).

🌟 Impact

✔️ Tamper-proof IDs → No fake tourist records.
✔️ Real-time safety → Faster response in emergencies.
✔️ Cross-state trust → Valid across India, not just one region.
✔️ User-friendly → No need for MetaMask, just login & go.

👉 “Travel Safe. Verified by Blockchain.”

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
